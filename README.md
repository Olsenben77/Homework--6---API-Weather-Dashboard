# Homework--6---API-Weather-Dashboard

# Homework-5-Daily-Planner

Our 6th coding project challenged us to generate multiple weather-based API's on a functional, forecasting webpage. The webpage prompts the user to select a city and then publishes relative, realtime data on their input. This display includes a city-search history, the current date, and a 5 day-forecast for the selected city. HTML and CSS were minimally involved, with most of the content being generated using JavaScript and JQuery.

## Motivation

We have begun learning about API's and JSON, and this project was a way to combine these skillsets.
I have been heavily focused on HTML and CSS over the past 5 assignments, so this project helped me to try using more JavaScript / JQuery. Even though this was out of my comfort zone, it was a great learning experience. API's are very useful, i.e. figuring out how to display them accurately on a webpage will come in handy on future tasks.

## Features

This application features a minimalistic display that includes a Navbar, input field, and search button. When the user types in a city of their choice, an API is called and information is returned from local storage on that city's weather. Weather information includes a weather icon, temperature, wind speed, and even a UV Index. A 5-day forecast for that specific choice is given as well, giving the user a full-scope on the weather for that week. City choices are also stored on the page, making a living history of user inputs. This application features multiple API's pulling from the "openweathermap" website.
